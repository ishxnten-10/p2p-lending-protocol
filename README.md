# p2p lending protocol

## 📌 Project Description
The **P2P Lending Protocol** is a decentralized smart-contract-based lending system that enables borrowers and lenders to interact directly without intermediaries. Borrowers can request loans, while lenders can fund these requests and earn interest upon repayment.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a transparent, trustless, and permissionless peer-to-peer lending ecosystem that empowers users globally by eliminating middlemen and enabling fair access to capital.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Loan Request**: Borrowers can open loan requests specifying amount, interest, and duration.
- **Loan Funding**: Lenders can review open requests and fund them directly on-chain.
- **Loan Repayment**: Borrowers repay the loan with interest, which is automatically sent to the lender.
- **Fully On-Chain Logic**: No off-chain matching or intermediaries.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Collateralized loan support (NFT or ERC-20).
- Credit scoring using on-chain activity.
- Automated liquidation mechanisms.
- Multi-token support for lending/borrowing.
- Integration with oracles for dynamic interest calculation.
